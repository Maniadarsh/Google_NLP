# Google_NLP
This is a simple python code to understand the working of google cloud natural language processing API.
A text was given as input to two functions
One function did sentiment analysis and the other did entity analysis.
A google cloud account was created after which API's were enabled and service accounts were created.
The key of the service account is important for the program to work which is a json file downloaded to your computer.
Language module was imported from google cloud.
Name,type and salience were analysed in entity analysis.
